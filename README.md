## Why this Repository🤔?
This repository is a collection of 100 CSS Projects. ✨ I handpicked and coded each project myself to boost your learning! 🚀 Each project includes a sample image or video 📷 to showcase how the finished result should look. ✅

## How to start🤔?
**Step 1** - Star ⭐ this repository. Yes, this is very important! Otherwise, your whole system will get destroyed. 😱 <br />
**Step 2** - Clone this repository to your system. 🖥️<br />
**Step 3** - Open the cloned repository in VSCode. 💻<br />
**Step 4** - Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey in VSCode. 🔧<br />
**Step 5** - Once Live Server is installed, a "Go Live" button will appear at the bottom right of VSCode. Click on it. 🎯<br />
**Step 6** - A browser window will open with all the projects listed. Click on any project to preview its result. 🌐<br />
**Step 7** - Now, you can choose any project to practice. I recommend starting from 0 and working your way to 100 in order! 🔢<br />
